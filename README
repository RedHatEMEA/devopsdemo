DevOps demo v0.1
Jim Minter <jminter@redhat.com>, 28/07/2014


Getting started
---------------

* You'll need access to an OpenStack project and a keystonerc file (hint: go to http://<openstack-hostname>/dashboard/project/access_and_security/api_access/openrc/ ).
* Create yourself an OpenStack SSH keypair and remember its name.
* For now, ensure all IP traffic can pass in the default OpenStack security group firewall.

Create the file infrastructure/environment.yaml, based on infrastructure/environment.yaml.example.
* public_net should be populated with the UUID of your public network (use the 'neutron net-list' to get this).
* key_name should be the name of the keypair you created earlier.

* "Source" your keystonerc file by typing the following:
  $ . keystonerc
* Run deploy/infrastructure_install.sh to create your DNS and OpenShift servers.

* Run deploy/application_install.sh to deploy the application.
